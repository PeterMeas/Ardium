# Tests

This directory will contain all testing code for the Ardium project.

## Testing Strategy

The testing framework will include:

- **Unit Tests**: Testing individual components and functions
- **Integration Tests**: Testing component interactions
- **Performance Tests**: Benchmarking and performance validation
- **Security Tests**: Security vulnerability testing
- **End-to-End Tests**: Complete workflow testing

## Test Organization

Tests will be organized to match the source code structure:
- `unit/` - Unit tests
- `integration/` - Integration tests
- `performance/` - Performance benchmarks
- `security/` - Security tests
- `e2e/` - End-to-end tests

## Running Tests

Instructions for running tests will be provided once the testing framework is established.
